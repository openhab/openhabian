## IMPORTANT: installing openHAB 4 ## June 25, 2023
We will install openHAB 4 from now on. It will be the latest available milestone
release until general availability of the openHAB 4 release.

## IMPORTANT: openHAB branch to install openHAB 4 ## June 3, 2023
We will change the default branch name to "openHAB".
If you are on the default branch openHAB3 so far, please use menu option 01 to
change to openHAB branch when you upgrade/move to openHAB 4.

## IMPORTANT: Java 17 is now the default ## March 22, 2023
As upcoming openHAB 4 will require Java 17 to run, it's time to move so from
now on we install Java 17 by default.
NOTE: openHAB 3.X is said to work with but isn't thoroughly tested on Java 17
so you might run into issues when you install 3.X.
This is also a request to all of you to gather and share experiences.
Please switch to (via menu) the *main* branch of openHABian or install it
right away as using the default branch (openHAB3) will keep installing Java 11
for the time being. Let us know your feedback via forum.
You can also change java versions via menu or on install via openhabian.conf.
