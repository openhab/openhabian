## Frontail removed ## December 17, 2024
We have removed the frontail log-viewer package and deleted it from all
systems with openHAB 4.3 or later installed. As of openHAB 4.3 a log-viewer
is built in to openHAB, and frontail has serious security vulnerabilities
present and is no longer maintained. We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause.

## Legacy openHAB 2 support removed ## November 23, 2024
We have removed legacy support for the openHAB 2 systems. Please upgrade to
the latest version of openHAB to receive further support.
