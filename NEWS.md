## WiFi Hotspot
Whenever your system has a WiFi interface that fails to initialize on installation or startup,
openHABian will now launch a [WiFi hotspot](docs/openhabian.md#WiFi-Hotspot) you can use to bootstrap WiFi i.e. to connect your
system to an existing WiFi network.

## Tailscale VPN network
Tailscale is a management toolset to establish a WireGuard based VPN between multiple systems
if you want to connect to openHAB(ian) instances outside your LAN over Internet.
It'll take care to detect and open ports when you and your peers are located behind firewalls.
This makes use of the tailscale service. Don't worry, for private use it's free of charge.

## Auto-backup
openHABian can automatically take daily syncs of your internal SD card to
another card in an external port. This allows for fast swapping of cards
to reduce impact of a failed SD card.
The remaining space on the external device will be made use of for openHABian's Amanda backup system.
