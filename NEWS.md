## Frontail removed ## December 18, 2024
We suggest removal of the frontail log-viewer package on all systems with
openHAB 4.3+. There is still an option to keep it or install it however it
is no longer supported and is provided as is. The reasoning for removal is
that frontail has serious security vulnerabilities present and is no longer
maintained.

openHAB 4.3 adds a new builtin logviewer. You can look forward to it
becoming even more capable over the coming months as it is refined as well.

## Legacy openHAB 2 support removed ## November 23, 2024
We have removed legacy support for the openHAB 2 systems. Please upgrade to
the latest version of openHAB to receive further support.
