# Network UPS Tools: example upsd configuration file
#
# This file contains access control data, you should keep it secure.
#
# It should only be readable by the user that upsd becomes.  See the FAQ.
#
# Each entry below provides usage and default value.

# =======================================================================
# MAXAGE <seconds>
# MAXAGE 15
#
# This defaults to 15 seconds.  After a UPS driver has stopped updating
# the data for this many seconds, upsd marks it stale and stops making
# that information available to clients.  After all, the only thing worse
# than no data is bad data.
#
# You should only use this if your driver has difficulties keeping
# the data fresh within the normal 15 second interval.  Watch the syslog
# for notifications from upsd about staleness.

# =======================================================================
# STATEPATH <path>
# STATEPATH /var/run/nut
#
# Tell upsd to look for the driver state sockets in 'path' rather
# than the default that was compiled into the program.

# =======================================================================
# LISTEN <address> [<port>]
# LISTEN 127.0.0.1 3493
# LISTEN ::1 3493
#
# This defaults to the localhost listening addresses and port 3493.
# In case of IP v4 or v6 disabled kernel, only the available one will be used.
#
# You may specify each interface you want upsd to listen on for connections,
# optionally with a port number.
#
# You may need this if you have multiple interfaces on your machine and
# you don't want upsd to listen to all interfaces (for instance on a
# firewall, you may not want to listen to the external interface).
#
# This will only be read at startup of upsd.  If you make changes here,
# you'll need to restart upsd, reload will have no effect.

# =======================================================================
# MAXCONN <connections>
# MAXCONN 1024
#
# This defaults to maximum number allowed on your system.  Each UPS, each
# LISTEN address and each client count as one connection.  If the server
# runs out of connections, it will no longer accept new incoming client
# connections.  Only set this if you know exactly what you're doing.

# Listen to ALL local IPv4 & IPv6 addresses to allow network connection
LISTEN 0.0.0.0 3493
LISTEN :: 3493
