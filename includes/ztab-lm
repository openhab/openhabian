#
# All algorithms in /proc/crypto are supported but only lzo-rle, lzo, lz4, and
# zstd have zramctl text strings; lzo-rle is the fastest with zstd having much
# better text compression.
#
# mem_limit is the compressed memory limit and will set a hard memory limit for
# the system admin.
#
# disk_size is the virtual uncompressed size approx. 220-450% of memory
# allocated depending on the algorithm and input file. Don't make it much higher
# than the compression algorithm is capable of as it will waste memory because
# there is a ~0.1% memory overhead when empty
#
# swap_priority will set zram over alternative swap devices.
#
# page-cluster 0 means tuning to singular pages rather than the default 3 which
# caches 8 for HDD tuning, which can lower latency.
#
# swappiness 80 because the improved performance of zram allows more usage
# without any adverse affects from the default of 60. It can be raised up to 100
# but that will increase process queue on intense loads such as boot time.
#
# target_dir is the directory you wish to hold in zram, and the original will be
# moved to a bind mount 'bind_dir' and is synchronized on start, stop, and write
# commands.
#
# bind_dir is the directory where the original directory will be mounted for
# sync purposes. Usually in '/opt' or '/var', name optional.
#
# oldlog_dir will enable log-rotation to an off device directory while retaining
# only live logs in zram. Usually in '/opt' or '/var', name optional.
#
# If you need multiple zram swaps or zram directories, just create another entry
# in this file.
# To do this safely, first stop zram using 'sudo zram-config "stop"', then edit
# this file.
# Once finished, restart zram using 'sudo systemctl start zram-config.service'.
