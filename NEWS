This is the new announcement page to pop up whenever you start openhabian-config and there's significant news we would like to share with you. Hit tab to unselect buttons and scroll through the text using UP/DOWN/PG UP/PG DOWN.

We start by introducing a new versioning scheme of openHABian. Please welcome *stable* branch. Similar to openHAB where there's releases and snapshots, you will from now on be using the stable branch. It's the equivalent of an openHAB release.
We will keep providing new changes to the master branch first as soon as we make them available, just like we have been doing in the past. If you want to keep living on the edge, want to make use of new features fast or volunteer to help a little in advancing openHABian, you can choose to switch back to the master branch.
Anybody else will benefit from less frequent but well better tested updates to happen to the stable branch in batches, whenever the poor daring 'master' people have reported their trust in these changes to work flawlessly.
You can switch branches at any time using the menu option 01.
