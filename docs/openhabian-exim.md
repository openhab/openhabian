## Mail Transfer Agent configuration

When you choose the "Mail Transfer Agent" install option in `openhabian-config` menu to install `exim4` as the mail transfer agent on your system, you will be presented with a number of questions on how to relay emails through a public service such as Google gmail.
In case you enter anything wrong you can re-initiate the installation process from the openHABian menu.

Note sending mails is an optional feature. If installing any other package such as the Amanda backup led you to MTA setup here, you can cancel it or enter whatever information so it won't work afterwards. Amanda will keep working, you just won't get any report mails.

::: tip Relaying via mail.gmail.com or mail.gmx.net
Both of these freemailers will only forward your mail when you authenticate with your Google/GMX username first.
Additionally, GMX requires the "From:" address to be your GMX mail address.
Google allows for arbitrary From: but will override any From: with your Gmail address.

Google meanwhile enforces more strict anti-spamming so authenticating with your standard credentials likely won't work
any more to send mail. With two factor authentication (2FA) you can generate a static password token for use with applications such as email in your Google account.
If you don't want to use 2FA or your personal account for this purpose, you can generate a secondary one.
